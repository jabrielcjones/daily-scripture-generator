VERY fun project I made for a coding challenge with some friends -- 

Built with React, Next JS and Tailwind CSS. Deployed with Vercel. Used NPM for icons and sharing. 

The scriptures are housed within an array of objects.

I wanted a really simple and clean UI and I believe I achieved that here.

I am passionate about reading scriptures that are historically accurate, so all of the scriptures have the Hebrew name for "The Lord". 

I built this in one day and you can view the project below

I'm looking forward to improving this as time goes along!
